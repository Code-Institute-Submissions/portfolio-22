# Francois Wilken - Portfolio

The high level purpose of this project is to conceptualise, scope, design and build an attractive and dynamic portfolio website which outlines the capabilities of a Full Stack Software Developer (Francois Wilken). 
It should visually attract an independent business owner or Small-Medium Enterprise (SME) in either employing the developer as a temporary contractor, full time developer or for the developer to use the portfolio to showcase their previous work when bidding on Freelancing work. 
The website needs to demonstrate the developers ability to work with the outlined programming languages, frameworks, methodologies and work ethics. 
The website should also have a personal element about the developer and their interests. 
The “Tech Blog” will be used to demonstrate, through article writing and publishing, that the developer is practising continuous learning, demonstrating curiosity and staying up to date with modern technology. 

As a high level overview, the website will demonstrate:

- Welcome / Landing Page (Career Summary)
- Skills (Current and Future)
- Experience
- Contact details.
- A “Tech Blog”.

 
## UX
 
The UX process for this project was to establish clarity from the start on the intended audience and ensure that the absolute core requirements are part of the scope. Essentially, the
design process was to create a simple, clear and easily viewable website which provides all necessary information and features, without bloating the website with unnecessary content.

The below user stories encapsulate the over all goals of the project and clearly outline the objectives and the intentions of the website:

- As a recruiter I want to visit this site's home page so that I can get a brief overview and introduction of the developer.
- As a recruiter I want to navigate between the different pages of this site so I can further explore the developers portfolio and read more about them.
- As a recruiter I want to view their technical / professional skills so that I can potentially hire the developer.
- As a recruiter I want to view their previous experience so that I can determine if they have the required skills for a job.
- As a recruiter I want to view some previous customer testimonials so that I can determine if this is a good developer to work with.
- As a recruiter I want to view the developers contact details so that I can contact them for an open position / project idea.
- As a recruiter I want to be able to connect with the developer on other platforms such as LinkedIn / Instagram / Github.
- As a recruiter I want to be able to read a technical blog by the developer to get a better understanding if they are staying on top of market trends and are performing their own research.

Wireframes for the Project are hosted below. These outline the basic intended structure of the website, although the structure did change slighltly throughout the development process as the web page did not render in the browser as well with the wireframes specific structure.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Navigation bar
 
The navigation bar is intended to be simple and clear, which brings you to the different pages on the website. On Mobile and Tablet view, the nav bar items should be displayed when the user taps or clicks on a hamburger icon in the top right.

- Footer

The footer bar is designed to allow the user to visit Social Media, Github Respositories and other platforms the developer uses.

- Welcome / Landing Page

This will be the Homepage of the website. This page will summarise and detail the developer’s personal bio. A short summary of skills, achievements, technology stacks they use and a brief description of their core competencies (Professionalism, communication skills etc)

- Skills (Current and Future)

The skills page will summarise the technical and core competency skills of the developer at a detailed level. It will also use some graphical representation which will make it easy for a potential employer or customer to gauge the skills of the developer (Bar Chart)

- Experience

The experience page will provide a timeline of the developers work history, outlining key achievements with some data to support the achievements (if available) and also any applicable customer / employer testimonials (if available)

- Contact Details

This will be a page where any potential clients can make contact across multiple platforms (Email, LinkedIn, Telephone etc.) with the developer to scope a project, enquire about services or reach out with any general queries.

- Tech Blog

The last page of the website is to be used as a “Tech Blog” where the developer will post an article about trending technology news / developments in the tech industry on a bi-monthly basis. This demonstrates that the developer stays up to date with current technologies and has a keen interest to practice continuous learning. It also adds a “personal dynamic” to the website based on the developers interests.

Ability to switch between Light and Dark mode on the website.

- Mailto: Modal

A model which allows the user to send an email from the website to the developer.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
